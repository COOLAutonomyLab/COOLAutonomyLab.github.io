# Real-Time Decision Making for Autonomy

The Control, Optimization, and Online Learning (COOL) for Autonomy lab at the [University of Texas, Austin](https://www.ae.utexas.edu) focuses on developing advanced real-time decision-making strategies for automy to compelemt humans in performing complex tasks. We are very interested in any opportunities to educate and train the next generation of scientists, researchers, and engineers in the rapidy advancing field of autonomy. Together as a team we are definitely COoLer, have more fun, and can do much better.
