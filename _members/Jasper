Jasper is our lab mascot. Jasper is a one year-old labradoodle. He can often be found underneath Julia's desk. He enjoys cuddling graduate students struggling with code and eating cheeseburgers. His research focuses on the development of the best position to take a nap in. While in undergrad at the University of Miami, Jasper enjoyed going to the beach... however, he is not sure how he feels about the New England cold water. Jasper is completing his DOGtorate and hopes to become a PAWfessor one day!
